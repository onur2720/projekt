# What is our projekt about??#

With this exam-project, we are trying to develope a platform in which both local citizens as travelers have acccess to book tours in Copenhagen. On this page you will find tour-information, guide-profile and the reviews from previous customers. The platform aims to avoid advanced features and complicated course of action. Instead the purpose of the platform is to create a simple and close link between the customers and supplier in location / on tour. 
Thus, a person who chooses to register as a customer (user) of the platform is pledged access to the most vital information, in relation to the trip that the person has booked or intends to reserve, instantly.

# Who are we? #
We are a group of students working on our exam-project in JavaScript programming. The goal is to develop a simple, small and easy-to use platform, which can carry out simple tasks.

# What is this? #
The purpose of this platform is to create a simple and easy tool for tourguides and their customers to get in touch. The tourguides have the opportunity to create a tour and change the information of existing tours, which will then be communicated to the customer. The customer gets the opportunity to book a tour.


# Where is the actual program? #
This is the complete version of the program as for now. As a part of a school project we were instructed to create a program, that looks similar to what a small, functioning program could look like. 
Further changes in this document can be found in the Git-repository on Github (onur_2720) at https://github.com/onur2720/projekt and the changes will be pushed as they are made.
In order to maintain simplicity, we have enlisted all the working and operating files within the Master folder. These are the files that constructs our program, and every JavaScript file has it's own HTML file as well. Many of the comments within the operating files has been moved to increase transparency, but can be found in the Old_code folder.
Furthermore, every file is named as the function or operation it is meant to carry out. GuidePage.js contains the JavaScript code for the guidepage, and Login.js contains the JavaScript code for the login page.

# How #
The program is simple in it's use, and starts with the user being able to create a user and log in. This page can be found in the login.html, and from here, it is possible to log in and book a tour. Even though, you will need to either login with the existing admin users in order to create a tour, which can be found in the login.js file, or you can simply add your own.
From this point, the program will redirect your through the journey!


# Future plans #
This project will be updated with new functions as soon as the plan for the new features (or optimizations) gets aired. Many of the functions, which are lacking correct coding (such as the payment class) will be further developed.
