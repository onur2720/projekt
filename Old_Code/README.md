# What is our projekt about??#

With this exam-project, we are trying to develope a platform in which both local citizens as travelers have acccess to book tours in Copenhagen. On this page you will find tour-information, guide-profile and the reviews from previous customers. The platform aims to avoid advanced features and complicated course of action. Instead the purpose of the platform is to create a simple and close link between the customers and supplier in location / on tour. 
Thus, a person who chooses to register as a customer (user) of the platform is pledged access to the most vital information, in relation to the trip that the person has booked or intends to reserve, instantly.
